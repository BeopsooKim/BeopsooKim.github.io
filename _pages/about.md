<aside>
ðŸ‘‹ Glad to see you!
**Beopsoo Kim** is the fourth-year Ph.D candidate student (Integrated course) in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Inha University**
My **research interest** includes

1. Developing an optimal control algorithm for AC-DC hybrid power grid
2. Developing analysis algorithms of AC-DC hybrid power grid response
    1) Power flow analysis
    2) Fault analysis
    3) Stability analysis
3. Using optimization/control algorithms and theory to inform the design of more effective electrical power system

Mr. Kim is researching in the **[Intelligent Power Grid Lab](https://inhapower.oopy.io/)** under the supervision of **[Dr. Insu Kim](https://inhapower.oopy.io/members/professor)**.

Before joining ECE, Inha University, Kim received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Inha University, Incheon, South Korea. in 2020. He was awarded the 'IEEE Student Paper Award' and 'Bronze prize in the 2018 Student Contest on Power Systems Engineering Software' during his B.S. degree. He also won the 'IEEE Student Paper Award' during his graduate course. He has been a student member of the KIEE , IEEE Seoul Section, IEEE PES and Cigre since 2018, 2021 and 2022.
